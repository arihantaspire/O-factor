The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has caught many businesses off-guard. The Covid-19 situation has also had adverse effects on the realty sector. As the market has been challenging for other sectors and industries, the Covid-19 situation has lowered the transaction with near-zero site visits in real estate.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as the saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s only when the night is darkest that the sunshine comes\u201d. The lockdown period has made every business to work with a contingency plan. And <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.asl.net.in\/index.html\"><b>real estate <\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is no exception. As in other industries, realtors are also now exploring newer options.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the increasing market demands and changing landscapes, the real estate professionals are now trying for alternative options and one is definitely- the online medium. As consumers are spending more time online, social media is certainly a relevant platform.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Realtors can now provide a clear projection of their site and projects which is far more appealing. They can now lucratively advertise and reach out to thousands of customers at one time through social media. On the other hand, even consumers can grasp more details at one glance.<\/span><\/p><h3><b>Traditional vs Online Real Estate Deals<\/b><\/h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For any individual investing in a house is equal to their life savings. It is a well-thought-out plan to dwell in. In the earlier days, costumers would look for properties in person, visit the site, check the local surroundings, and then invest in a house. As much as it is a time-consuming task, it was equally essential.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what has changed?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the process is still the same. The only difference is that now you can find all these details online. Customers can check out complete site plans, site details, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.asl.net.in\/changing-lifestyle.html\"><b>property designs online<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In fact, with the current digital mediums, customers can even take a 360 tour of the site just by sitting in their houses. Social Media also enables one to understand the location and its added attributes wisely.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advanced technologies have empowered real estate organizations to showcase their projects spectacularly in a detailed manner. This provides the customers the ease and convenience to check every detail which they might miss during their visit.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Further are a few gripping benefits of social media for consumers for buying real estate:<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1. Time-saving:<\/strong> While you may like to go and check a site physically, you may still miss the details. In such a case, an online tour saves a huge time. You not just focus on the details you want to know, but also get extra information that is value-adding to your decision-making process.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>2. Higher-engagement:<\/strong> While you may plan to buy a real estate property in a particular location, social media can help you share and seek insights with other family members and friends. You don\u2019t need to click pictures and videos to share, you can simply share the site details in a single click with whomever you wish to before you decide.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Easy-to-connect:<\/strong> If you are looking to speak to someone after you have seen an advertisement, social media makes your work easier. Rather than just engaging with a consultant, you can directly speak to relationship managers and consult on your real queries with proper answers.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4. More options:<\/strong> As offline information might be limited, you have more options today in the online world. Social Media gives you the excellent chance of looking out for a variety of options to compare with before you invest.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, the accountability and influence of social media are massive. Leveraging Social Media for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.asl.net.in\/ongoing-projects.html\"><b>buying houses<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is indeed a safe, reliable, and convenient option in such adverse conditions .<\/span><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The year 2020 has been a real roller-coaster.
