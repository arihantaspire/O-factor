					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>Investing in real estate at any time of the year is an ingenious move. It customarily fetches the buyer good returns on the investment. However, Diwali is considered the most auspicious and “shubh” time of the year that one could buy a property in. It has become a tradition as the festival of lights is believed to bring brightness and joy to the new house you move into. Most citizens or investors purchase property in Diwali, hence it gaining the title of The Biggest Real Estate Festival Of The Year!</p><p>Here are a few reasons as to why you should consider investing in a house of your own in Diwali 2021:</p><ol><li>Illuminating offers and discounts:</li></ol><p>The offers presented by some real estate companies are as illuminating as your house during the festive season! Perks like zero stamp duty, home appliances, cashback, no EMIs, or lower interest rates are given by real estate developers.</p><ol start="2"><li>Grandiose and fresh launches:</li></ol><p>Diwali calls for the boom of the real estate sector- the developers launch new, attractive and affordable projects as the competition is level pegging. Hence, the prospective buyers have a varied range of properties to choose from, fitting their budget.</p><ol start="3"><li>Enhanced funds in the buyer’s hands:</li></ol><p>Festive bonuses, pay hikes, etc. are common to all career people. Investing these extra funds in real estate will get you contentment shortly, making the investment ROI positive. Down payments can also be made easier with the influx of income.</p><ol start="4"><li>Benefits of the Un-lockdown:</li></ol><p>The pandemic lockdown severely had its effect on the real estate sector just like all the other branches worldwide. To recover from it, developers have set low prices to get the business back up again. This combined with the Diwali offers makes it all the more fitting to get your own home this season!</p><ol start="5"><li>Free goodies are an added benefit!</li></ol><p>To make the deal made with the buyer during the festive season, developers tend to send free gold coins, LCD televisions, and other expensive handouts. </p><p>If you are planning to invest in a property/invest in a house that will further benefit you in the future, Diwali of 2021 is the exemplary time you should!</p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>“A house is made of bricks and beams. A home is made of hopes and dreams.” Home can exclusively be your own living space. It is a place where you feel comfortable, content, and satisfied. Having your own house in the contemporary world may seem like a dream to many citizens. However, it is now facile to turn it into reality as well. With the assistance of real estate offers, more people have been able to achieve their goals. Exciting deals like 3BHK at the price of 2BHK, customized payment plans, referral and loyalty schemes, etc. are recurrent lately. Renting can seem like a cheaper option originally- but is it practical in the<br />long run? There is no building of equity, no fixed housing costs, etc. Moreover, there are a few benefits that renting cannot provide but owning a house surely does. The comparison is listed below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Buying is cheaper than renting:</strong><br />This may seem like baloney, but if you consider the longer run- owning a house is assuredly cheaper. This gets proven if you compare the overall rental fees to the fees of owning a house. Additionally, it is better to pay for your own house rather than to pay for someone else’s asset.</p>
<p><strong>2. Investing in real estate- an intelligent choice:</strong><br />Real estate investing is a secure investment that is backed by a tangible asset and has the potential for capital development as well as tax benefits. Buying a house will generate continuous passive income. As the value of the property increases, it becomes an excellent long-term investment too!</p>
<p><strong>3. Provides stability to the homeowners:</strong><br />Renting means moving from one place to another when your rental agreement expires. Doing this practice for years causes additional funds, instability, lack of peace, etc. Owning your own house provides solidity and a peaceful environment for the entire family- a place where memories are created together! The rental costs are even conserved to build your net worth.</p>
<p><strong>4. Absolute immunity and power:</strong><br />You do not like the paint in the kitchen? You can repaint it! You can even remodel your entire house, change the tiles, refurnish it, etc. All liberties and benefits are omitted if you plan to rent. In the former, you do not have to worry about any contracts, conditions, and extra fees. You rule your lifestyle!</p>
<p><strong>5. Reselling/renting out can profit you more than you paid!</strong><br />As we discussed earlier, real estate investment is the best investment you could make- for a reason. It is an ever-growing sector with soaring income. Once you plan to resell your house after a few years, the price of the house will have distinctly increased. Therefore, you end up earning more than you invested in the beginning. You can even rent it out as a secondary form of income!</p>
<p>Buying a house may pinch your pocket at first, but it is a clever decision ultimately. You will profit from it sooner ‘and’ later! It has many paired benefits to it that you can enjoy too if you plan to invest in a house today.</p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 hasn’t been kind to India’s economy. The diminishing market movements led to significant business losses for sectors like real estate. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last 11 months, Maharashtra’s real estate sector has undergone noteworthy alterations. The 8-months downward slope took a swift upward shift when the sectoral activity resumed in June. In this process, while the Mumbai Metropolitan Area (MMR) has recorded a 60% increase in property sales, Navi Mumbai’s performance has outshined others by a huge margin. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Source: Liases Foras Report]</span></i></p><h2><b>Navi Mumbai Sectoral Geography Is Working Well </b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slashed stamp duty</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reduced home loan interest rates, and generous </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit-linked subsidies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are working their charm on prospective buyers. This explains the rising sectoral performance on a macro front. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what makes Navi Mumbai so special than other zones is its prime location that connects well to the rest of the MMR. This, in particular works particularly well for corporate professionals who intend to save housing costs whilst looking for a convenient commute to their office locations in the city. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 312% increase is a very promising statistic &amp; works as a great motivational booster for real-estate agents to perform better. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the rising affordability stems from the fact that Navi Mumbai offers one of the broadest ranges of price bands that successfully serves varying expectations. </span></p><h2><b>Urbanization is leading to Real-Estate </b><b>Positive Externalities </b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navi Mumbai is witnessing a significant transformation in its physical infrastructure. The onset of major projects like the Navi Mumbai International Airport, Ghansoli’s 5 million IT Square Park “Q PARC”, the Navi Mumbai Metro, and the Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop Project amongst many others have instilled positive sentiments across a wide audience.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong social infrastructure consisting of notable schools (Ryan International, DAV International), colleges (NMIMS, NIFT), parks (Central Park), malls (Seawoods Grand Central, Inorbit), and sports complexes (Golf Course) are increasingly drawing individuals &amp; families in the vicinity. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors augment the developmental efforts of major projects like </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-aalishan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arihant Aalishan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kharghar), </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-anshula.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arihant Anshula </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Tajola Phase II), </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-anmol.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arihant Anmol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Badlapur East), and many others in the zone. </span></p><h2><b>With an exception, of course </b><b> </b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The zonal performance is booming, except for Thane recording an 8% slump in the July-September quarter. While there is no concrete explanation for this downslide, it doesn’t disrupt the average performance of the other zones, outstandingly. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sharp revival in 3 months has helped lift the real estate dead weights. Given the current trends, the industry expects the curve to experience an upwards trajectory shortly.</span></p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>Buying a home in the city of dreams Mumbai can be a challenging task. While you dream of Mumbai the newest destination for real estate investment is in Navi Mumbai. The real estate in Navi Mumbai has been surging since the last decade. Navi Mumbai has become one of the most demanded areas in Mumbai which attracts a large number of Indians and ex-pats to settle in. Finding <a href="https://www.asl.net.in/ongoing-projects.html"><strong>affordable properties in Navi Mumbai</strong> </a>can be difficult if you do not reach out to reputed developers.</p><p>To help you out in your search for an affordable dream home in Navi Mumbai, here’s a quick checklist that can help you:</p><p><strong>Research</strong></p><p>As real estate is a rising industry, you may get many options if you want to buy a property in Navi Mumbai. Yet, you must do proper research and find the best property in Navi Mumbai<strong>. </strong>While affordable houses<strong> </strong>may be available in huge numbers, it is integral to choose a genuine realtor. You definitely cannot compromise on the quality of the house you choose. </p><p><strong>In-person visit</strong></p><p>As online media is booming, real estate is also making itself available online for customers with virtual tours displaying <strong><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-4anaika.html">flats for sale in Navi Mumbai.</a> </strong>However, an in-person visit can help you understand the property better. A visit to the property can help you gauge more details like the real appearance, understanding of space, and details about the building. </p><p>Additionally, if you are buying a property in Navi Mumbaithen visiting the<strong> </strong>places can help you with an understanding of the neighbouring area, the locality, and the people. Remember, a little hard work can help you buy the best property.</p><p><strong>Research About Neighbourhood</strong></p><p>Neighbourhoods play a vital role in determining the cost of a property. Therefore, if you are planning to buy the<strong><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-4anaika.html"> best property in Navi Mumbai</a>,</strong> check out details about the neighbourhoods before taking the final decision. Find areas that are safe and residential to live in. It is a must for happy living.</p><p><strong>Connectivity </strong></p><p>The mode of communication is another important factor that you must check if you are searching for pocket-friendly properties in Navi Mumbai. Check out the availability of public transport, distance from the property to the nearest railway station, airport, hospital, school, and market. You can buy a low-cost property and then you may have to spend extra money every day to travel. It will surely defeat your motive of buying an ‘affordable’ home. Thus, look for areas that provide convenient traveling and avoid any probable hassle. </p><p><strong>Connect To Reputed Developers</strong></p><p>Several developers are offering you <a href="https://www.asl.net.in/contact-us.html"><strong>real estate properties in Navi Mumbai</strong>.</a> But finding a reputed developer can be tricky. You can check out the best developers in Navi Mumbai who can guide you through buying the best property within your budget. It is imperative to check through with them and understand all possibilities. </p><p>However, most people come to Mumbai with their dreamy eye and real estate is an expensive business. There is no denying that real estate has become costlier, but you may have the opportunity to get better within your budget if you do a proper search. Searching for budget-friendly properties in Navi Mumbai can be hectic, but with the right guidance and lead, you may find the best property in Navi Mumbai within your budget. </p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2020 has been a real roller-coaster. The sudden outbreak of the pandemic has caught many businesses off-guard. The Covid-19 situation has also had adverse effects on the realty sector. As the market has been challenging for other sectors and industries, the Covid-19 situation has lowered the transaction with near-zero site visits in real estate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the saying goes, “It’s only when the night is darkest that the sunshine comes”. The lockdown period has made every business to work with a contingency plan. And </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/index.html"><b>real estate </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is no exception. As in other industries, realtors are also now exploring newer options.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increasing market demands and changing landscapes, the real estate professionals are now trying for alternative options and one is definitely- the online medium. As consumers are spending more time online, social media is certainly a relevant platform.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realtors can now provide a clear projection of their site and projects which is far more appealing. They can now lucratively advertise and reach out to thousands of customers at one time through social media. On the other hand, even consumers can grasp more details at one glance.</span></p><h3><b>Traditional vs Online Real Estate Deals</b></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any individual investing in a house is equal to their life savings. It is a well-thought-out plan to dwell in. In the earlier days, costumers would look for properties in person, visit the site, check the local surroundings, and then invest in a house. As much as it is a time-consuming task, it was equally essential.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has changed?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the process is still the same. The only difference is that now you can find all these details online. Customers can check out complete site plans, site details, and </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/changing-lifestyle.html"><b>property designs online</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, with the current digital mediums, customers can even take a 360 tour of the site just by sitting in their houses. Social Media also enables one to understand the location and its added attributes wisely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced technologies have empowered real estate organizations to showcase their projects spectacularly in a detailed manner. This provides the customers the ease and convenience to check every detail which they might miss during their visit.</span></p><p><b>Further are a few gripping benefits of social media for consumers for buying real estate:</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Time-saving:</strong> While you may like to go and check a site physically, you may still miss the details. In such a case, an online tour saves a huge time. You not just focus on the details you want to know, but also get extra information that is value-adding to your decision-making process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2. Higher-engagement:</strong> While you may plan to buy a real estate property in a particular location, social media can help you share and seek insights with other family members and friends. You don’t need to click pictures and videos to share, you can simply share the site details in a single click with whomever you wish to before you decide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3. Easy-to-connect:</strong> If you are looking to speak to someone after you have seen an advertisement, social media makes your work easier. Rather than just engaging with a consultant, you can directly speak to relationship managers and consult on your real queries with proper answers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4. More options:</strong> As offline information might be limited, you have more options today in the online world. Social Media gives you the excellent chance of looking out for a variety of options to compare with before you invest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the accountability and influence of social media are massive. Leveraging Social Media for </span><a href="https://www.asl.net.in/ongoing-projects.html"><b>buying houses</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is indeed a safe, reliable, and convenient option in such adverse conditions .</span></p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you thinking of buying a new house or constructing your own dream house?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in the present scenario, constructing a house from scratch can be challenging. Instead, a lot of people are opting for finished flats to cope up with their busy schedule as well as the budget. After all, when compared buying a flat is less stressful in terms of both- budget and time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with budget and schedule, Vastu is also considered as an essential criterion while purchasing a new property. It includes a set of principles that are believed and followed by an enormous number of people. Hence, if you are considering to <a href="https://www.asl.net.in/arihant-anshula.html">buy a ready to move-in flat</a>, check out the following segment which includes an extensive list of important Vastu tips to take into consideration while buying a flat:</span></p><p><b>1.Entrance: </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">East and North East side is usually favoured for the entrance of a flat. According to Vastu shastra, the presence of the entrance in such directions attracts positivity and good luck. Additionally, the South or West direction is not considered as a good sign for the entrance of a flat.</span></p><p><b>2.</b><b>Common Wall Apartment</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vastu shastra, the presence of a common sharing wall between yours and the neighbouring apartment can bring in a possibility of assorted energies to enter your house. In such a case, it is better to avoid a flat with a common sharing wall. </span></p><p><b>3.Sunlight And Ventilation</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light holds a great deal of importance in Vastu shastra. As morning sunlight is usually considered to be a source of positivity, Vastu shastra prefers the presence of Windows and balconies in the north or east direction. Morning sunlight is also considered to be beneficial for health.</span></p><p><b>4.Living Room</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vastu shastra, the presence of your living room in the east direction is beneficial as it helps in the development and strengthening of social relationships. </span></p><p><b>5.Kitchen Room</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any house, the kitchen room is always an integral part. According to Vastu shastra, the south-east corner of your flat is usually preferable for the kitchen. The southeast direction should be chosen for placing the gas or stove. In such a case, the person will be facing the east direction only to prepare food.</span></p><p><b>6.Bedroom</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of the bedroom in the east and southeast direction might trigger anxiety and conflict. It is therefore advised to prevent having the bedroom in such a direction. </span></p><p><b>7.Toilet </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vastu shastra, the presence of the toilet between the north and northeast direction is not recommended for a flat, as it might affect the immunity of a person.</span></p><p><b>8.Number Of Doors And Windows </b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vastu shastra, for each floor, it is recommended to have an even number of doors and windows. But this number should not have a zero at its end, as in the case of 10 or 20.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a checklist will only help you influence your decision in a positive direction. After all, the purchase of your dream home is a one-time deal. Therefore, opt only for the best when you are investing in a real estate property. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p></div>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced us to many unforeseen changes. The importance of one’s ‘own home’ has come into play – significant contributors driving this change: the half-year lockdown &amp; the new work-from-home norm. However, with businesses plummeting &amp; the economy reporting an all-time negative GDP, is it prudent to buy a property in Maharashtra?</p>



<p><strong><em>The Government of Maharashtra’s recent decision will answer this concern in the form of the following three benefits:</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em><u>Saving Costs</u></em></strong></p>



<p>Starting <em>September 1, 2020</em>, the <strong>existing 5%</strong> stamp duty (in urban areas) has been reduced to <strong>2%</strong> until <em>December 31, 2020</em>. Post which, the duty rises to <strong>3%</strong> from <em>January 1 – March 31, 2021</em>. This is a significant incentive for homebuyers to capitalize upon this temporary but highly lucrative opportunity.</p>



<p><em>Not convinced? Let’s take some statistics here:</em></p>



<p>An ideal home in Maharashtra is available at exorbitant prices.</p>



<p>Let’s take Rs 1 Crore in our example. Earlier, the stamp duty &amp; registration charges would have been Rs 5 Lakh &amp; Rs30,000respectively. With the amendment, the liability reduces to Rs 2 Lakh &amp; Rs 30,000 until 2020 &amp; Rs 3 Lakh &amp; Rs 30,000 until 2021 first quarter.</p>



<p><strong>Result? </strong>Savings of Rs <strong>3 Lakh &amp; 2 Lakh</strong> (respectively)!</p>



<p>Extending on this principle, the stamp duty has been slashed from <strong>4% to 1% </strong>in rural areas until <em>December 2020</em>, which rises to <strong>2%</strong> until <em>March 2021</em>.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Benefits for Home-Loan Seekers</u></em></strong></p>



<p>In an attempt to revive activity in the real estate sector, there have been some interesting changes brought upon by RBI &amp; the government. The <em>reduced repo (4%), lower interests on home loans, and credit-linked subsidies qualified under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)</em> serve as promising signals for prospective buyers.</p>



<p>Moreover, with the reduced stamp rates, a loan seeker can also leverage their status under <em>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961</em>. The maximum value eligible for deduction stands at <strong>Rs 1.5 Lakh for the Principal &amp; Rs 2 Lakh on the interest accrued</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><em><u>Sentimental Values</u></em></strong></p>



<p>There is no replacement for the emotional sentiments attached to residing at one’s <strong><em>own</em></strong> home. After all, if this pandemic has taught us anything, it has been the greater value that a home can leverage upon its owner – both financially &amp; emotionally. Don’t sit on your inhibitions. Make your move, today.</p>
