										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unstoppable novel-coronavirus [<strong>COVID-19</strong>] has revolutionized global operations &amp; ways-of-living since early 2020. While breaking the transmission of the virus, the importance of <strong>owning a home</strong> has (significantly) come into play.</p>
<p>In a recent survey conducted in 10 major cities, including Mumbai, it has been found that <em>65%</em> of Indians are actively searching for properties in this pandemic market. Of these, <em>77%</em> are intending to purchase for end-use whereas <em>23%</em> are aiming for investment purposes.</p>
<p>As a prospective home buyer, you may face dilemmas concerning if this is the right time to invest. Given the shrinking economy &amp; plummeting incomes, what are the benefits of buying a home in the <strong>Post-COVID World</strong>?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Emotional Well-Being </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>India has been under lockdown for more than 6 months. Sure, the economy is opening &amp; activities are resuming. But question yourself – how favorable do the odds look for functioning again with the ‘old norms’?</p>
<p>This lockdown was especially difficult for tenants – with some migrating back to their natives. Initially, there was no lax on paying monthly rents. Some were forced to vacate the houses on account of non-payments.</p>
<p>However, when purchasing a home, the <em>one-time investment</em> may feel overwhelming – but the <em>emotional peace</em> of living comfortably without any fears supersedes everything else.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Living the New Norm </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With work-from-home &amp; virtual schooling being adopted as the new norm – owning a home, especially for working professionals &amp; families, has become prudent.</p>
<p>But the question is – how do you manage your finances for making a real estate investment?</p>
<p>This leads to our next points:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Government Relaxations </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In our previous article, “<em>Maharashtra Cuts Stamp Duty: 3 Main Benefits for Homebuyers</em>”, we’ve talked about how the (temporary) reduced stamp duty valid from September 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020, &amp; January 1, 2021- March 31, 2021, will work in the favor of home loaners &amp; prospective buyers concerning tax concessions &amp; leveraging opportunities on credit interest subsidy schemes.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Build Your Savings </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With RBI slashing <em>repo &amp; reverse repo rates to 4% &amp; 3.35%</em>, the sector has observed a <em>domino effect</em>. Home loans are staggering at an <em>all-time low</em> between <em>7.15 to 7.8%.</em></p>
<p>These reduced rates provide a home borrower with leverage to capitalize on these savings &amp; invest it for his/her future benefits. For example, owning a home in a more luxurious area than thought about before the incentives.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Real Estate as an Asset </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Market reports confirm investor sentiments. In the pandemic, <em>31%</em> of people have increasingly shifted their investment preferences towards real estate. It has been termed as a <em>stable asset</em> that will yield fruitful returns in the long-run.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>55% of homebuyers &amp; 60% of tenants</em> confirm the speculations regarding virtual tours. They believe this to be a sufficient tool for shortlisting property decisions – likely to boost sector capital.</p>
